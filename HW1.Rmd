## Q1 (1 pts)

##### The dataset `quakes` contains information about earthquakes occurring near Fiji since 1964. The first few observations are listed below. 

```{R}
head(quakes)
```

##### How many observations are there of each variable (i.e., how many rows are there; show using code)? How many variables are there total (i.e., how many columns are in the dataset)? You can read more about the dataset [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/quakes.html) *Do not forget to include the code you used to find the answer each question*

```{R}
# your code here
dim(quakes)
```

*Your typed answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*  
The dataset quakes has 1000 observations on 5 variables.

## Q2 (2 pts)

##### What are the minimum, maximum, mean, and median values for the variables `mag` and `depth`? Note that there are many functions that can be used to answer this question. If you chose to work with each variable separately, recall that you can access individual variables in a dataframe using the `$` operator (e.g., `dataset$variable`). Describe your answer in words.

```{R}
# your code here

#Values for variable mag

max(quakes$mag)
mean(quakes$mag)
median(quakes$mag)
min(quakes$mag)

#Values for variable depth

max(quakes$depth)
mean(quakes$depth)
median(quakes$depth)
min(quakes$depth)
```

*Your typed answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

I found the maximum,minimum,median and mean values by accessing variables mag and depth in the quakes data frame. The max of variable mag was 6.4,the mean was 4.6204,the median was 4.6 and the minimum was 4.The max of variable depth was 680, the min was 40, the mean was 311.371 ,and the median was 247.

## Q3

##### Recall how logical indexing of a dataframe works in R. To refresh your memory, in the example code below I ask R for the median magnitude for quakes whose longitude is greater than 175. The two ways produce equivalent results.

```{R}
median(quakes$mag[quakes$long>175])

median(quakes[quakes$long>175,]$mag) #this is the more conventional notation
```

### 3.1 (1 pt) 
##### Explain what each of the two lines of code are doing in words. Specifically, why do we need to use the comma in the second case but not in the first? Remember that the `$` selects a single variable and that `[ ]` are used for indexing whatever object came before (either a single variable or a dataframe).

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

The first line of code is first accessing variable mag and declaring mag to be what we are interested in to find the median.Then from there we are accessing all the observations on longitudes that are greater than 175.

The second line of code is first accessing the variable longitude and filtering out by longitudes greater than 175 with the comma. Then we access the mag variable and find the median.




### 3.2 (3 pts) 
##### What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's depth and its magnitude?

```{R}
# your code here
mean(quakes$mag[quakes$depth>median(quakes$depth)])
mean(quakes$mag[quakes$depth<median(quakes$depth)])

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

The mean of mag when the depth is greater than the median depth is 4.5232 and when it is less than the median depth it is 4.7176.This suggests that there is an inverse relationship between depth and magnitude.

### 3.3 (2 pts) 
##### What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the standard deviation of the variable `lat` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth? What does this suggest about the relationship between an earthquake's latitude and it's depth?

```{R}
# your code here
sd(quakes$lat[quakes$depth>median(quakes$depth)])
sd(quakes$lat[quakes$depth<median(quakes$depth)])
```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

The standard deviation of latitude when the depth is greater than the median depth is 3.577252 and the standard deviation when the depth is lower than median depth is 6.1501. This suggests that the lower in depth the more deviated the latitude is from the mean; This is because the median is a larger number.


## Q4 (2 pts)

##### The variable `depth` is measured in kilometers. Create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives depth **in meters rather than kilometers** and add it to the dataset `quakes`. To help get you started, I have given you code that creates the new variable but fills it with `NA` values. Overwrite the `NA`s below by writing code on the right-hand side of the assignment operator (`<-`) that computes the requested transformation. Print out the first few rows of the updated dataset using `head()`.

```{R}
# update the code below by replacing the NA with the correct expression to convert to meters
quakes$depth_m <- quakes$depth*1000
head(quakes)
```


## Q5

##### Let's make some plots in base R. 

### 5.1 (2 pt) 
##### Create a boxplot of `depth` using the `boxplot()` function. Describe where you see the min, max, and median (which you calculated in question 2) in this plot.

```{R}
# your code here
boxplot(quakes$depth,main = ' Boxplot of Depth')

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

The median is the bolded black line towards the bottom of the plot at 247. The minimum is the short line at the bottom of the plot at 40. The maximum is the short line at the top of the plot at 680.

### 5.2 (2 pt) 
##### Create a histogram of `depth` using the `hist()` function. What important information does the histogram provide that the boxplot does not?

```{R}
# your code here
hist(quakes$depth,main='Histogram of Depth',xlab = 'Depth')

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

The histogram provides a more in-depth view of the data whereas the boxplot just gives the summary of the data.The histogram provides the frequencies and shows how much variance there is in the data. 

### 5.3 (2 pt) 
##### Create a scatterplot by plotting variables `mag` and `stations` against each other using the `plot()` function. Note that to generate a scatterplot, the `plot()` takes two arguments: the x-axis variable and the y-axis variable. Describe the relationship between the two variables.

```{R}
# your code here
plot(quakes$mag,quakes$stations,main = ' Scatterplot of Magnitude Vs Stations',xlab = 'Magnitude' , ylab = 'Stations')

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

There is a positive relationship between magnitude and news stations. As magnitude increases,stations are more likely to report an earthquake.

### 5.4 (3 pt) 
##### Create scatterplot of the quakes' geographic locations by plotting `long` on the x-axis and `lat` on the y-axis. Using this plot, and the map/link below (note the two trenches), and some of the techniques you practiced above, are deeper quakes more likely to originate east or west of Fiji?

[Link to location on Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@-20.1679389,175.7587479,3513560m/data=!3m1!1e3)

```{R fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
# your code here
plot(quakes$long,quakes$lat)

```

*Your answer goes here. 1-2 sentences only.*

Based on the scatter plot,there are several more points on the longitudes greater than 175, which means that there are more earthquakes on the east of Fiji.
